Objection,Rebuttal
I don’t really drive the car that much anymore.,"Totally understand—this coverage protects when something goes wrong, not how often you drive. Your odds don’t reset with low miles."
"Totally understand” builds rapport Education: It re-frames the logic — protection is about risk, not frequency Challenge: “Your odds don’t reset with low miles” is a direct pattern interrupt that sticks “Can you just send me an email? I want to look it over.","Of course—but real quick, let’s go over it together now so you know exactly what to look for when you open it."
"I’ve already got coverage.” Perfect—so you already see the value in having protection. This just ensures you’re not overpaying for less coverage."" ✅ Positioning: Frames them as smart (positive reinforcement) ✅ Reframes: Now we’re not selling, we’re optimizing ✅ Challenger logic: Overpaying for less? That stings and opens the door for a compare/contrast This is textbook Challenger with a consultative twist — builds trust and makes them curious. “It just costs too much right now.","I hear you—and that’s exactly why most folks lock it in now, before the price jumps again or a repair wipes out their savings."
"I hear you” = empathy) ✅ Flips urgency on its head — “It’s too much” becomes the reason to act now ✅ Creates fear of inaction: price hike or repair = both cost way more This is classic Challenger + NLP pressure relief valve: → You’re not pushing, you’re protecting. → You’ve reframed “price” as the danger zone, not the solution. “I haven’t even bought the car yet—I’m just seeing what it would cost.",Smart thinking—most folks wait until after and lose the better rates. You’re ahead of the curve right now.
"most people” lose by waiting ✅ Positioning: Frames now as the optimal time to buy, not “too early” It’s a great rapport-builder and a smooth setup for moving into the close — especially when paired with a soft question like: “If the numbers make sense now, would you want to lock it in before they change?” “Can I call you back later?","Sure—but in my experience, ‘later’ usually turns into ‘never’ once that check engine light comes on. Let’s at least finish this part."
Let me think about it.,"Of course—just curious, what part needs more thinking: the price, the coverage, or if your car's even worth protecting?"
"Of course” = softens the entry) ✅ Challenger reframe — forces them to label the objection, so you can isolate and destroy it ✅ Implies absurdity — “Is your car even worth protecting?” plants the idea that not doing this is irrational This is a power play in disguise — you stay polite while regaining control. “I need to talk to my wife about it.","Of course—quick question: if she says yes, are you all in? And if she says no, what do you think she’d say it about?"
"If she says yes, are you all in?” — this isolates the real decision-maker ✅ Future pacing: It makes them imagine her saying yes or no ✅ Objection mining: The second question pulls the real objection into the open (money? trust? need?) This is the judo move of sales — you let them talk, but you control the direction. I’ll do it later—maybe next month when I’ve got more money.",Totally understand—but these prices don’t wait for budgets to catch up. Let’s see what we can do to bridge the gap.
Let’s see what we can do…” keeps them engaged instead of ending the convo It subtly shifts the energy from delay to solution — and that’s how you win. “I need to sleep on it.,"Totally fair—if you wake up tomorrow and the price’s gone up or your car breaks down, what would you do?"
A” is the heavyweight here. 🔍 Why it's the best: ✅ Empathy + subtle fear of loss ✅ It gently makes the customer visualize the cost of waiting ✅ It challenges without attacking — a Challenger ninja move This is a perfect urgency reframe. It keeps them in the conversation without pushing too hard. “I’m not ready to make a decision yet.,"Got it—quick question, what do you feel is missing from the picture that’s stopping you?"
Can you send me something to look at?,"Sure thing—just so I don’t waste your time twice, let’s go over the important parts now so the email actually makes sense."
waste your time twice” triggers a double-take ✅ Establishes the value of the call before they disengage It makes them realize that the email is useless without the walkthrough — brilliant control disguised as help. “I already have coverage through my dealership.,That’s a good start—most dealership plans end early and don’t include a lot of the stuff that actually breaks. Mind if we compare real quick?
I don’t drive the car that much.,"Totally fair—but coverage protects when something breaks, not how often you drive. Your odds don’t reset with low mileage."
Totally fair” lowers resistance ✅ Logical reframe: separates usage from risk ✅ NLP pattern interrupt: “your odds don’t reset” is a sticky truth that makes them pause This is elite-level objection handling — it reprograms how they view the whole risk model. “I’m not interested.,Totally fine—I wouldn’t be either without knowing what this actually covers. Mind if I show you real quick?
I wouldn’t be either…” lowers resistance instantly ✅ Gives them a reason to stay — implies they don’t have enough info yet ✅ Soft permission close — “Mind if I show you real quick?” keeps control while making it feel optional This is a gentle redirect that keeps you in the driver’s seat without making them feel sold — perfect for early resistance. “I don’t need this—I’ve never had a breakdown.,Totally makes sense—and most folks haven’t… until they do. One repair changes the whole math.
"makes sense” builds rapport ✅ Reality check: “until they do” triggers future risk thinking ✅ Cost anchor: “One repair changes the whole math” taps into the real pain = unexpected cost This is the kind of line that quietly hits hard — no push, no fluff, just truth. “I’m just looking—I’m not ready to buy anything.",Perfect—you’ll know a smart move when you see one. Let’s walk through what smart actually looks like today.
looking” with high-status energy ✅ Reframes “just looking” as not enough ✅ Drives momentum without sounding pushy This is a Challenger power play — you validate and redirect with authority. “I just want to know the price.,Of course—but price without coverage is like a menu with no food. Let’s make sure it even fits what you need first.
"menu with no food” creates a mental image that sticks ✅ Controls the conversation — resets the frame from price first to value first ✅ Respectful authority — you’re guiding, not selling This is textbook Challenger: flip the frame, reassert your role as the expert, and give them a reason to listen. “I want to wait until after I take the car to my mechanic.",Fair point—but what would your mechanic say about driving without coverage between now and then?
The car’s still under manufacturer warranty.,"Totally makes sense—and that’s exactly when most people qualify for the best rate, before the factory one runs out."
"Totally makes sense” keeps rapport intact ✅ Social proof: “most people qualify” adds validation ✅ Scarcity + timing: Urgency without fear — just smart timing This is a low-pressure, high-authority way to create FOMO around factory warranty expiration — great play. “If something breaks, I’ll just pay out of pocket.",Sure—but why gamble with 4 grand when a couple bucks a day could wipe that risk out?
"a couple bucks a day” hits hard ✅ Challenge tone: Not aggressive, but it puts their logic on trial — and wins This is pure Challenger persuasion — exposes the downside of their plan while presenting your offer as the obvious smarter play. “I’ve had bad experiences with extended warranties before.",I hear you—and that’s exactly why we go over this in detail now so there are no surprises later.
I hear you” validates without minimizing ✅ Builds trust: Emphasizes transparency ✅ Future-paced reassurance: You’re framing this call as the solution to past problems This is a trust-builder disguised as a close — perfect when someone’s been burned before and just wants clarity. “I want to talk to a friend/family member who knows more about cars.,"Totally fair—but just so they’re giving you advice on the right info, let’s walk through it now."
you don’t need them” This line disarms politely while maintaining momentum — and that’s how you win the “friend knows more” objection. “I want to wait until my tax refund comes in.,"Totally understand—just keep in mind, one breakdown could turn that refund into a down payment on a repair bill."
"Down payment on a repair bill” makes them see the pain ✅ Respectful tone: Starts soft, finishes strong This is powerful psychological framing — you're not just saying “bad things can happen,” you're showing them how easily that tax money disappears. “I already work with a mechanic I trust.","That’s great—this doesn’t replace them, it just makes their job cheaper when something big breaks."
"makes their job cheaper” = win-win This one preserves the trust they have in their mechanic, while adding your value to the equation — perfect blend of logic and reassurance. “Can I think about it and call you back?","Of course—just so I don’t waste your time twice, let’s knock out the basics while I’ve got you."
"Of course”) disarms the stall ✅ Pattern interrupt: “waste your time twice” is a subtle jab that sticks ✅ Keeps control: Redirects the conversation without arguing This line is all about respectful dominance — you’re still in charge, but it feels like you’re doing them a favor. That’s high-level salesmanship. “I want to wait until I hit a certain mileage.",Totally fair—just know that mileage doesn’t cause breakdowns. Time and wear do. Let’s get ahead of it.
Let’s get ahead of it” brings them back into momentum This is a trust-builder and logic-resetter — it gets them thinking beyond odometers and toward the real risk. “Can you just give me the monthly payment?,"Definitely—but just so it actually means something, let’s first see what you’d be getting for that monthly."
"Definitely” = low resistance ✅ Shifts the frame from price → value — critical move ✅ Subtle authority — you’re leading the conversation, not reacting This is how a true closer operates: You don’t refuse to give the number — you show them why it’s irrelevant without context. Beautiful balance of respect and control. “I don’t plan to keep the car that long.","Totally fair—just so you know, this transfers with the car and adds value when you sell it."
"I won’t use it” to “Wow… this could help me sell it faster or for more.” “I’m retired, so I don’t drive as much as I used to.","Even better—retired drivers usually qualify for lower rates, and this keeps your fixed income protected."
I’ve heard bad things about companies like this.,"That makes sense—lots of fly-by-nights out there. Luckily, we’ve been around for years and everything’s backed in writing."
"Been around for years” = credibility ✅ Reduces fear with a hard guarantee: “everything’s backed in writing” This response validates their concern, but more importantly, it shifts the conversation toward proof and protection. It’s strong, safe, and still forward-moving. “What if I cancel or change my mind later?","Totally fair—and that’s why you’ve got a 30-day review window to cancel, refund, or switch it if needed."
Refund or switch” = they’re in the driver’s seat ✅ Specificity builds credibility — 30-day window sounds official and policy-backed This is how you eliminate hesitation without losing momentum — structure + certainty = confidence. “I don’t want to make a decision on the spot.,"Totally get it—just curious, what would you need to see to feel confident about moving forward today?"
I need to wait until my next paycheck.,Totally makes sense—but waiting could cost you a lot more than a payment. Let’s see if we can stretch this to fit.
"Totally makes sense” softens the start ✅ Fear of inaction — “cost you more than a payment” = pain anchor ✅ Flexible close — “stretch this to fit” keeps the convo open and solutions-focused This is sales jiu-jitsu — you flip their delay into an invitation to solve the money problem now, not wait for a miracle next paycheck. “I don’t like giving my info over the phone.","Totally fair—my job’s just to walk you through it, not to pressure you. And everything is secured and recorded for your protection."
"sell,” you’re here to serve ✅ Builds trust: “Secured and recorded” sounds official and safe ✅ Empathetic & calm: Creates a sense of professionalism and control This is how you turn an anxious buyer into a confident one — safety, structure, and zero pressure. “Can you match another quote I got?","Possibly—just remember, cheapest isn’t always safest. Let’s make sure you’re not saving pennies to spend thousands."
"Saving pennies to spend thousands” is a strong visual ✅ Confidence play: You’re not chasing the quote — you’re protecting the customer This is a Challenger-style flex — you lean into your authority, not away from their comparison. It elevates you while making the competitor look risky without saying anything negative. “I’ve never heard of your company.","Totally fair—we’re not the loudest, but we’ve been around a long time and back everything with real coverage in writing."
"Totally fair” keeps them calm ✅ Longevity = credibility — “been around a long time” combats fear of fly-by-night ✅ Tangible proof — “coverage in writing” signals real legitimacy This is low-key power — no bragging, just facts and security. It earns trust without sounding defensive or salesy. “I just want the cheapest plan.","Sure—just depends what you want covered. Cheapest usually means paying more when it breaks, not less."
"Sure” keeps things easy and non-confrontational ✅ Educates through contrast — explains why “cheap” can cost more ✅ Avoids insult — doesn’t shame them, just nudges them toward smarter value This is how you guide a budget-minded customer without pushing them off the ledge — you redirect instead of reject. “I don’t really keep cars long—I trade them in pretty often.","Totally fair—this coverage goes with the car, and actually increases its trade-in value."
"trading in” becomes an advantage, not a reason to avoid coverage ✅ Highlights transferability — most people don’t know that ✅ Adds financial benefit — “increases trade-in value” gives them ROI language This turns their objection into a value booster and reinforces the idea that the plan is an asset, not just protection. “I just don’t trust warranty companies.","That’s reasonable—trust is earned. Let me walk you through this one, and you can decide if we’re different."
"If it breaks, I’ll just get rid of the car.",Understandable—just know most buyers won’t touch a car that’s not running. Let’s keep it market-ready.
"market-ready” speaks their language ✅ Consultative tone — you sound like a car advisor, not a sales rep This line challenges gently while showing them the real-world consequences of letting a repair kill their resale game. Very high-level move. “I just don’t want to commit to anything right now.","Totally fair—this isn’t about locking you in, it’s about making sure you can decide while the option’s open."
I’ve been fine without coverage this whole time.,True—but one repair is all it takes to make ‘fine’ feel like a really expensive gamble.
"True” keeps rapport strong ✅ Punchy reframe — “fine” becomes dangerous with one incident ✅ Cost anchor — connects emotionally and financially This is a mic-drop line — it leaves them thinking, “Am I really just gambling right now?” Perfect final impression that challenges without pushing. How much is this a month? I’ve asked 3 times already ""Totally fair—I'm not trying to dodge the question, I just want to make sure we’re not putting a price tag on something that might not even be a fit."" ✅ Validates their frustration without apologizing or giving control away ✅ Maintains authority — reminds them you're here to guide, not just quote ✅ Pattern interrupt — redirects the conversation back to qualification and value This line defuses tension, takes back control, and positions you as the expert. That’s how pros protect pricing power. “$4,500? That’s insane. I could buy another car for that.","Right—but would that car come with guaranteed coverage, or just more unknowns?"
"buy another car” logic. “Okay then, just send me the quote. I guess this call is over.” (She’s about to hang up) ""Totally get it. Just remember—if the car breaks down before you get that next quote, this is the call you’ll wish you said yes to."" ✅ Fear-based reframe — plants a costly “what-if” in their brain ✅ Powerful last impression — hits emotionally after the call ends ✅ Reclaims the frame — you’re not chasing… you’re warning This is how you control the final scene of the movie, even if they walk out of the theater. “That seems really expensive—CarShield quoted me $95/month and you’re at $155.",That’s fair—but let’s stack the plans side by side and see if we’re even comparing apples to apples.
I can’t do $175 down today—I don’t have it until the 3rd of next month.,"No problem—just know the rate is based on today’s mileage. If you’re still under, I can lock this in and delay billing."
My dealership offers the same coverage and it’s longer—for half the price.,"Fair—but just curious: did they show you what’s actually included, or just the total cost?"
